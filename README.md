What I learned
In this project we were shown to API calls using AJAX. I had a lot of fun with this one as well as a challenging time with it. I really enjoy getting live data to use in projects that can be useful to anyone. I've somewhat learned how to read through API documentation to see how to implement said data and utilize javascript/jquery to input that data into the DOM.
